SuperDuperFastTableView
===================

This is the fastest TableView with large images around. This kicks the shit out of any other project. The new Facebook native app is slow as shit compared to this project. You will see more images faster. No more black ImageView's when scrolling (cop out by Facebook camera app). The beauty of this project is not seen until you have 1 bar on a 3G connection. 

Includes image caching (memory and disk), image prefetching, low res + high res images (low res when scrolling) and is compatible for iPhone 5 screen size. 

I am pulling images from my Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. 

Code is a little messy. Using this project as a proof of concept. 

I am using MKNetworkKit with a bunch of custom stuff added on top.
