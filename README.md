AutoDropboxUploader
===================

Wouldn't it be cool if Dropbox automatically synced all your photos and videos on your iPhone without you having to anything? The newest version claims exactly that but falls short. 

The latest dropbox version uploads photos/videos only if the app is open or within 10 minutes of the last close. Re-open the app every time I want to sync, this fucking sucks. 

This project is a full featured dropbox client that uploads without the app open. There is no 10 minute window and it will even send a push notification if somehow the app has been terminated from the background (never happens). 

I will submit this app to the app store once completed.
